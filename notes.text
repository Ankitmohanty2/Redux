q3: functionalities of redux
-> Redux provides a way to manage the state of your application in a predictable and consistent way. It allows you to store the state of your application in a single object called the store, and provides a set of functions to update the state of the application. Redux also provides a way to subscribe to changes in the state of the application, so that you can update the user interface when the state changes.

## Introduction
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the state in a way that is consistent and scalable, making it easier to develop complex applications with a clear flow of data.

## State Structure
Redux state is typically organized into a single JavaScript object that contains various slices, each representing a different part of the application's data. Keeping the state normalized (flat structure) is crucial for performance and maintainability.

Example State Structure:
```javascript
{
  user: {
    isAuthenticated: false,
    userInfo: null,
  },
  posts: {
    byId: {
      "1": { id: 1, content: "Hello World" },
      "2": { id: 2, content: "Redux is great!" }
    },
    allIds: [1, 2]
  },
  comments: {
    byPostId: {
      "1": [ { id: 1, content: "Nice post!" } ]
    }
  }
}

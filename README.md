# Redux Overview

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications. It helps you manage application state efficiently, ensuring that state transitions are predictable, making debugging and maintenance easier.

## 1. Introduction

Redux revolves around three core principles:  

1. **Single Source of Truth**: The state of the entire application is stored in a single object tree.  
2. **State is Read-Only**: The only way to change the state is by dispatching actions.  
3. **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**: Reducers specify how the state changes in response to actions.  

## 2. State Structure

The Redux state is a centralized object tree that represents the entire application. For scalability, divide the state into slices representing different parts of the app.  

```javascript
const reduxExample = {
  user: {
    isAuthenticated: false,
    userInfo: null,
  },
  posts: {
    byId: {
      "1": { id: 1, content: "Hello World" },
      "2": { id: 2, content: "Redux is great!" },
    },
    allIds: [1, 2],
  },
  comments: {
    byPostId: {
      "1": [{ id: 1, content: "Nice post!" }],
    },
  },
};
